RoboSpockExample
================
This is a simplified App Library Setup I use for some of my apps (ex: Battery Temperature guard: http://goo.gl/36srQ2).
My Android App Setup uses gradle to build an android library project. 

These Files are inside the folder AppLibrary.

This AppLibrary is a simple setup for a generic android app using an ActionbarActivity. I tried to simplify it as much as possible.
This android-library conains a few other depenencies like appcompat, aquery...

The App itself is inside the folder App.

This App uses AppLibrary to quickly build an android app with two simple Fragments.

The folder AppTests contains some RoboSpock setup. I try to use RoboSpock as a simple test framework for my Android App, but I can't get get the tests running).

I want to use this AppTests project to test the App.
